# DBMS-Infosys-sectionA-341027-341025-341038
This project designs a relational database system for Infosys Limited to manage its organizational structure, employees, projects, skills, and reporting hierarchy. It demonstrates essential DBMS concepts such as ER modeling, relational integrity, normalization, and complex relationships using primary and foreign keys.
# 📊 Organisational Database Management System – Infosys Limited

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an **enterprise-level relational database design** for modelling the organisational and operational structure of **Infosys Limited**, a global IT services company.  
The database captures real-world organisational complexity including hierarchy, employees, departments, projects, skills, performance management, and audit logging.

The system is designed using **advanced DBMS concepts** and implemented in **MySQL**, ensuring data integrity, scalability, and real-world applicability.
